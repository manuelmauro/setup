# setup.sh - Headless setup for Ubuntu development environment
This repository contains the script `setup.sh` which installs the following:

* build-essentials
* git
* oracle-java8-installer
* vim
* mongodb
* nodejs
* bower
* grunt

# dotfiles - some useful configuration file
Furthermore  this repo contains dotfiles for:

* bash
* vim
* gitmessage
* screen

I suggest to use [GNU Stow]{https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/} as described
in this
[article]{http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html}
in order to manage their symlinks.
